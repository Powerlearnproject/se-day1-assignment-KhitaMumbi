#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering is the application of engineering principles to the design, development, maintencance, testing and evaluation of software systems. Its importance in the technology industry are: Ensure high- quality software- By using established methodologies, software engineers can ensure that software is developed to meet high standards, and is free from defects and vulnerabilities. 
                        Scalability and flexibility- It allows the system to handle more users, data and requests, without compromising oerformance.
                        Cost- effectiveness- By detecting and fixing issues early in the development process, companies can avoid costly errors or rework later.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1950s-1960s: The term Software Engineering was coined. It set the foundation for later methodologies and practices.
1970s-1980s: Structured Programming was introduced as a method to improve software design and code quality. It led to better code readability, easier debugging, and improved software maintenance.
1990s-2000s: The rise of Agile methodologies as a response to the limitations of traditional software development processes. It revolutionalized software development by making it more adaptable, responsive to customer needsand focused on delivering working software at every stage of development.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Planning- define project goals
Requirement Analysis- gather functional and non-functional requirements
Design- define system architecture and componenets
Implementation- convert design into actual code
Testing- perform unit, intergration, system and user acceptance requirements testing
Deployment- release the software to the production environment
Maintenance and support- fix bugs and release uodates

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is structured and linear while agile is flexible and adaptive.
Waterfall folows a strict step by step while agile follows short cycles.
In Waterfall, it is difficult to make changes once a phase is complete. In Agile, changes can be made at any time.
In Waterfall, testing is done once development is complete while in agile, testing is done after every phase.
Waterfall methodology can be used for big stable projects like government healthcare.
Agile methodology requires adaptability and frequent updates so can be used on mobile apps.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer- Responsible for designing, writing, testing and mainatining the code that forms the software application. Some roles include: writing code, designing software, debugging and troubleshooting, writing unit tests.
Quality Assurance Engineer- Responsible for ensuring the quality of the software by testing it and identifying defects before the software is released. Some roles include: manual and automated testing, regression testing, collaboration with developers.
Project Manager- Responsible for overseeing the entire software development process, ensuring that the project is completed on time, within budget, and meets the defined requirements. Some roles include: defining project scope, managing resources, risk management.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Some importance of IDE's include: They increase productivity- provide features like syntax highlighting
                                  They reduce errors- offer real-time error detection and correction.
                                  Support multiple languages- they support multiple programming languages.
Importances of VC's: They facilitate collaboration- multiple developers can work on the code without conflict.
                    Enhance code security- prevent accidental data loss by storing data in repositories.
                    Track changes- maintain a history of modifications, to allow rollback if needed.
An example of an IDE is VS Code and an example of VC's is Git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Debugging and Troubleshooting- A way to overcome this would be by using debugging tools or implementing unit tests to catch errors early.
Managing time and meeting deadlines- This can be overcome by using task management tools to make work more organised.
Effective team collaboration- maintain clear and detailed documentation fro easy project flow.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing- focuses on testing individual componenetsor functions of the software in isolation. Its importance is to ensure each code works correctly.
Intergration testing- verifies that different componenets or modules work together as expected. Its importance is to ensure seamless communication between different parts of the system
System testing- evaluates the entire intergrated system, to verify that it meets specified requirements and behaves as expected in all scenarios. Its importance is it verifies that the software works as a complete and cohesive product.
Aceeptance testing- typically performed by the end user to ensure that the software meets business requirements, and is ready for deployment. Its importance is it confirms that the software is suitable for release, and meets customer needs.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering is the process of defining and refining the inputs(or prompts) given to an AI model to elicit the most accurate , relevant, or useful responses.
Some of its importances are:
a) Enhancing model performance- It helps guide the AI's behaviors and responses in the right direction, especially when the task is complex or the question requires specific context.
b) Maximizing efficiency- With good prompt engineering, users can get more precise answers with fewer attempts.
c) Controlling output style and tone- Users can tailor responses for specific audiences or use cases.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
"Tell me about climate change"
Imporved prompt- Provide a detailed explanation of the primary causes of climate change, and how they have affected global temperatures over the last 50 years"
The improved prompt is more effective because it is clear, specific and concise.
