Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Planning- define project goals
Requirement Analysis- gather functional and non-functional requirements
Design- define system architecture and componenets
Implementation- convert design into actual code
Testing- perform unit, intergration, system and user acceptance requirements testing
Deployment- release the software to the production environment
Maintenance and support- fix bugs and release uodates

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is structured and linear while agile is flexible and adaptive.
Waterfall folows a strict step by step while agile follows short cycles.
In Waterfall, it is difficult to make changes once a phase is complete. In Agile, changes can be made at any time.
In Waterfall, testing is done once development is complete while in agile, testing is done after every phase.
Waterfall methodology can be used for big stable projects like government healthcare.
Agile methodology requires adaptability and frequent updates so can be used on mobile apps.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Some importance of IDE's include: They increase productivity- provide features like syntax highlighting
                                  They reduce errors- offer real-time error detection and correction.
                                  Support multiple languages- they support multiple programming languages.
Importances of VC's: They facilitate collaboration- multiple developers can work on the code without conflict.
                    Enhance code security- prevent accidental data loss by storing data in repositories.
                    Track changes- maintain a history of modifications, to allow rollback if needed.
An example of an IDE is VS Code and an example of VC's is Git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Debugging and Troubleshooting- A way to overcome this would be by using debugging tools or implementing unit tests to catch errors early.
Managing time and meeting deadlines- This can be overcome by using task management tools to make work more organised.
Effective team collaboration- maintain clear and detailed documentation fro easy project flow.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing- focuses on testing individual componenetsor functions of the software in isolation. Its importance is to ensure each code works correctly.
Intergration testing- verifies that different componenets or modules work together as expected. Its importance is to ensure seamless communication between different parts of the system
System testing- 
Aceeptance testing-


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
